# ffm-java-22-1-capstone

This is my graduation project from the ffm-java-22-1 course.

It's a library for BPMN-Diagrams from a Camunda Engine. You can fetch them from the engine or add custom ones, see the version history and add comments to every BPMN-diagram.


Requirements to run:

MongoDB on Port 8080

MongoDB Database name "BpmnLibrary"

Camunda Engine needs URL to Rest-API in property camunda.api.baseUrl=".../engine-rest"
